Candle/Flame-Simulator
================

Uses a trinket 3v, 5v or other arduino compatible and an adafruit neopixel stick (8 x WS2812 RGB leds)

great for simulating fire - uses combinations of red, yellow, and flickering to make it look like a flame.

You can increase the number of pixels used (default is 6) to increase the brightness and make it look like a bigger flame.

Tweak the colors and get unique flame colors - white, green, red, etc.
